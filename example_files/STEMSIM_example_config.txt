# Substitution model: must choose from JC69, K80, HKY85, TN93, REV
# JC69: The Jukes-Cantor model assumes equal base frequencies and equal mutation rates, therefore it does not have any free parameter.
# K80: The Kimura model assumes equal base frequencies and accounts for the difference between transitions and transversions with one parameter (alpha_transition is set to 1, only modify alpha_transversion).
# HKY85: The HKY85 model does not assume equal base frequencies and accounts for the difference between transitions and transversions with one parameter.
# TN93: The TN93 model has four frequencies parameters. It accounts for the difference between transitions and transversions and differentiates the two kinds of transitions (purine-purine & pyrimidine-pyrimidine).
# REV: The REV model is the most general model for nucleotide substitution subject to the time-reversibility constraint. It has four frequencies and five rate parameters.
